### Teaching Philosophy

<p align="justify">
I see the classroom as a **safe space** and **student centered**.
Essentially, I see teaching as a reinforcement of these two principles; making the classroom a safe and inclusive place for people (people in the broadest sense of the word) and also a place where the student feels in control of their education.

I've been fortunate enough to have tutored undergraduate students in Spanish and German language at the University Center for Academic Excellence at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Following this, I became a graduate teaching assistant during my Masters degree at the same institution, where I came to very much enjoy sharing my passion for languages with first and second year students as I taught first and second semester Spanish courses in a hybrid format (before covid made these cool).
After graduating with my Masters, I became a full time college instructor as a fellow in which I taught in both full time and hybrid contexts.
