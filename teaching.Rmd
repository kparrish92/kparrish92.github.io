### Teaching Philosophy

<p align="justify">
I see the classroom as a **safe space** and **student centered**.
Essentially, I see teaching as a reinforcement of these two principles; making the classroom a safe and inclusive place for people (people in the broadest sense of the word including all ethnicities, creeds, and identities) and also a place where the student feels in control of their education.
Starting out, I was fortunate enough to have tutored undergraduate students in Spanish and German language at the University Center for Academic Excellence at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Following this, I became a graduate teaching assistant during my Masters degree at the same institution, where I came to very much enjoy sharing my passion for languages with first and second year students as I taught Spanish courses in a hybrid format (before covid made these cool).
After graduating with my Masters, I became a full time college instructor as a fellow in which I taught in both full time and hybrid contexts.
I was able to continue teaching during my doctoral studies at Rutgers University, where I taught a variety of in-person and online courses. 
Additionally, I taught Spanish courses as an Adjunct Faculty member at Mercer County Community College during my PhD.
These days, I have the good fortune to teach courses in Hispanic linguistics at Goethe University in three languages! I teach intro to Syntax in German, Phonetics in Spanish, and several courses in English.
