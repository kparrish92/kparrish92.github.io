The first was done in 2018, but officially published in 2020 (Puig-Mayenco et al. , 2020).\nThe information coded here contains information from updated systematic review coded from the appendix reported in Rothman et al. (2019).\nEach study was coded for several factors: L1 influence, L2 influence, Typological Influence or hybrid influence.\nIn each case, a value of “1” meant that the study found that the L3 was influenced by the coded factor.\nNote that these factors were not mutually exclusive, such that some are coded as “1” for more than one potential explanation (e.g., some studies are coded as “1” for both L2 influence and typological influence).\nNext, “mirror image” refers to the use of mirror image groups within the study (opposite order of acquisition learning the same L3).\nThe following fields contain the author and year the study was published (many have the DOI linked), the languages involved, and whether the L3 showed evidence of non-facilitative transfer.\nOne can also use the search bar to filter for authors, languages, or any keyword contained in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWorkflow: basics\nYou now have some experience running R code.\nWe didn’t give you many details, but you’ve obviously figured out the basics, or you would’ve thrown this book away in frustration!\nFrustration is natural when you start programming in R, because it is such a stickler for punctuation, and even one character out of place will cause it to complain.\nBut while you should expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that it’s both typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and the only way to get over it is to keep trying.\nBefore we go any further, let’s make sure you’ve got a solid foundation in running R code, and that you know about some of the most helpful RStudio features.\nCoding basics\nLet’s review some basics we’ve so far omitted in the interests of getting you plotting as quickly as possible.\nYou can use R as a calculator:\n\n\n1 / 200 * 30\n\n[1] 0.15\n\n(59 + 73 + 2) / 3\n\n[1] 44.66667\n\nsin(pi / 2)\n\n[1] 1\n\nYou can create new objects with <-:\n\n\nx <- 3 * 4\n\n\nAll R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form:\n\n\nobject_name <- value\n\n\nWhen reading that code say “object name gets value” in your head.\nYou will make lots of assignments and <- is a pain to type.\nDon’t be lazy and use =: it will work, but it will cause confusion later.\nInstead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign).\nNotice that RStudio automagically surrounds <- with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice.\nCode is miserable to read on a good day, so giveyoureyesabreak and use spaces.\nWhat’s in a name?\nObject names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and ..\nYou want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words.\nWe recommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words with _.\n\n\ni_use_snake_case\notherPeopleUseCamelCase\nsome.people.use.periods\nAnd_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention\n\n\nWe’ll come back to code style later, in Chapter ?? on functions.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about about best practices for code style, I also recommend The tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org.\nYou can inspect an object by typing its name:\n\n\nx\n\n[1] 12\n\nMake another assignment:\n\n\nthis_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5\n\n\nTo inspect this object, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type “this”, press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.\nOoops, you made a mistake!\nthis_is_a_really_long_name should have value 3.5 not 2.5.\nUse another keyboard shortcut to help you fix it.\nType “this” then press Cmd/Ctrl + ↑.\nThat will list all the commands you’ve typed that start those letters.\nUse the arrow keys to navigate, then press enter to retype the command.\nChange 2.5 to 3.5 and rerun.\nMake yet another assignment:\n\n\nr_rocks <- 2 ^ 3\n\n\nLet’s try to inspect it:\n\n\nr_rock\n#> Error: object 'r_rock' not found\nR_rocks\n#> Error: object 'R_rocks' not found\n\n\nThere’s an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions.\nTypos matter.\nCase matters.\nCalling functions\nR has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:\n\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)\n\n\nLet’s try using seq() which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, learn more helpful features of RStudio.\nType se and hit TAB.\nA popup shows you possible completions.\nSpecify seq() by typing more (a q) to disambiguate, or by using ↑/↓ arrows to select.\nNotice the floating tooltip that pops up, reminding you of the function’s arguments and purpose.\nIf you want more help, press F1 to get all the details in the help tab in the lower right pane.\nPress TAB once more when you’ve selected the function you want.\nRStudio will add matching opening (() and closing ()) parentheses for you.\nType the arguments 1, 10 and hit return.\n\n\nseq(1, 10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nType this code and notice you get similar assistance with the paired quotation marks:\n\n\nx <- \"hello world\"\n\n\nQuotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair.\nRStudio does its best to help you, but it’s still possible to mess up and end up with a mismatch.\nIf this happens, R will show you the continuation character “+”:\n> x <- \"hello\n+\nThe + tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn’t think you’re done yet.\nUsually that means you’ve forgotten either a \" or a ). Either add the missing pair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.\nIf you make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value.\nYou’re then tempted to immediately double-check the result:\n\n\ny <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)\ny\n\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\n\nThis common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to happen.\n\n\n(y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5))\n\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\n\nNow look at your environment in the upper right pane:\nHere you can see all of the objects that you’ve created.\nExercises\nWhy does this code not work?\n\n\nmy_variable <- 10\nmy_varıable\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found\n\nLook carefully!\n(This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)\nTweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:\n\n\nlibary(tidyverse)\nggplot(dota = mpg) + \n  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))\n\n\nPress Alt + Shift + K.\nWhat happens?\nHow can you get to the same place using the menus?\n\n\n\n",
