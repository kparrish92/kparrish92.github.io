My main interests are in third language acquisition, phonetics and phonology, and language pedagogy. My primary aim/interest is how bilinguals acquire the phonetics and phonology of a third language. In particular, my research involves Spanish-English bilinguals and their learning of a new language with a focus on near first exposure. My recent projects have involved novel-language production by bilinguals, perception in the same population, and exploratory analysis related to which factors might be associated with the variation observed in cross-linguistic influence from either a first or second language in third language learning.

There were two systematic reviews done by Rothman and colleagues. The first was done in 2018, but officially published in 2020 (Puig-Mayenco et al. , 2020). The information coded here contains information from updated systematic review coded from the appendix reported in Rothman et al. (2019).\nEach study was coded for several factors: L1 influence, L2 influence, Typological Influence or hybrid influence. In each case, a value of “1” meant that the study found that the L3 was influenced by the coded factor. Note that these factors were not mutually exclusive, such that some are coded as “1” for more than one potential explanation (e.g., some studies are coded as “1” for both L2 influence and typological influence). Next, “mirror image” refers to the use of mirror image groups within the study (opposite order of acquisition learning the same L3). The following fields contain the author and year the study was published (many have the DOI linked), the languages involved, and whether the L3 showed evidence of non-facilitative transfer. One can also use the search bar to filter for authors, languages, or any keyword contained in the table.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"l1_influence\":[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\"l2_status\":[0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0],\"typology\":[0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],\"hybrid_influence\":[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],\"mirror_image_groups\":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0],\"author_year\":[\"Angelovska (2017) A\",\"Angelovska (2017) B\",\"Antonova-Ünlü & Sağın-Şimşek (2015)\",\"Bardel & Falk (2007)\",\"Bayona (2009)\",\"Ben Abbes (2016) A\",\"Ben Abbes (2016): B\",\"Ben Abbes (2016): C\",\"Berends et al.

      "contents": "\nWorkflow: basics\nYou now have some experience running R code. We didn’t give you many details, but you’ve obviously figured out the basics, or you would’ve thrown this book away in frustration! Frustration is natural when you start programming in R, because it is such a stickler for punctuation, and even one character out of place will cause it to complain. But while you should expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that it’s both typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and the only way to get over it is to keep trying.\nBefore we go any further, let’s make sure you’ve got a solid foundation in running R code, and that you know about some of the most helpful RStudio features.\nCoding basics\nLet’s review some basics we’ve so far omitted in the interests of getting you plotting as quickly as possible. You can use R as a calculator:\n\n\n1 / 200 * 30\n\n\n[1] 0.15\n\n(59 + 73 + 2) / 3\n\n\n[1] 44.66667\n\nsin(pi / 2)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\nYou can create new objects with <-:\n\n\nx <- 3 * 4\n\n\n\nAll R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form:\n\n\nobject_name <- value\n\n\n\nWhen reading that code say “object name gets value” in your head.\nYou will make lots of assignments and <- is a pain to type. Don’t be lazy and use =: it will work, but it will cause confusion later. Instead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds <- with spaces, which is a good code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day, so giveyoureyesabreak and use spaces.\nWhat’s in a name?\nObject names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. We recommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words with _.\n\n\ni_use_snake_case\notherPeopleUseCamelCase\nsome.people.use.periods\nAnd_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention\n\n\n\nWe’ll come back to code style later, in Chapter ?? on functions. If you’re interested in learning more about about best practices for code style, I also recommend The tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org.\nYou can inspect an object by typing its name:\n\n\nx\n\n\n[1] 12\n\nMake another assignment:\n\n\nthis_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5\n\n\n\nTo inspect this object, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type “this”, press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.\nOoops, you made a mistake! this_is_a_really_long_name should have value 3.5 not 2.5. Use another keyboard shortcut to help you fix it. Type “this” then press Cmd/Ctrl + ↑. That will list all the commands you’ve typed that start those letters. Use the arrow keys to navigate, then press enter to retype the command. Change 2.5 to 3.5 and rerun.\nMake yet another assignment:\n\n\nr_rocks <- 2 ^ 3\n\n\n\nLet’s try to inspect it:\n\n\nr_rock\n#> Error: object 'r_rock' not found\nR_rocks\n#> Error: object 'R_rocks' not found\n\n\n\nThere’s an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.\nCalling functions\nR has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like this:\n\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)\n\n\n\nLet’s try using seq() which makes regular sequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, learn more helpful features of RStudio. Type se and hit TAB. A popup shows you possible completions. Specify seq() by typing more (a q) to disambiguate, or by using ↑/↓ arrows to select. Notice the floating tooltip that pops up, reminding you of the function’s arguments and purpose. If you want more help, press F1 to get all the details in the help tab in the lower right pane.\nPress TAB once more when you’ve selected the function you want. RStudio will add matching opening (() and closing ()) parentheses for you. Type the arguments 1, 10 and hit return.\n\n\nseq(1, 10)\n\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nType this code and notice you get similar assistance with the paired quotation marks:\n\n\nx <- \"hello world\"\n\n\n\nQuotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair. RStudio does its best to help you, but it’s still possible to mess up and end up with a mismatch. If this happens, R will show you the continuation character “+”:\n> x <- \"hello\n+\nThe + tells you that R is waiting for more input; it doesn’t think you’re done yet. Usually that means you’ve forgotten either a \" or a ). Either add the missing pair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.\nIf you make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value. You’re then tempted to immediately double-check the result:\n\n\ny <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)\ny\n\n\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\n\nThis common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to happen.\n\n\n(y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5))\n\n\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\n\nNow look at your environment in the upper right pane:\nHere you can see all of the objects that you’ve created.\nExercises\nWhy does this code not work?\n\n\nmy_variable <- 10\nmy_varıable\n\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found\n\nLook carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)\nTweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:\n\n\nlibary(tidyverse)\nggplot(dota = mpg) + \n  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))\n\n\n\nPress Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?\n\n\n\n",

Casillas. in the Spanish and Portuguese Department at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I am also a current member of the Rutgers Applied Phonetics group working with Professor Casillas and other colleagues at Rutgers. My main interests are in third language acquisition, phonetics and phonology, and language pedagogy. My primary aim/interest is how bilinguals acquire the phonetics and phonology of a third language. In particular, my research involves Spanish-English bilinguals and their learning of a new language with a focus on near first exposure. My recent projects have involved novel-language production by bilinguals, perception in the same population, and exploratory analysis related to which factors might be associated with the variation observed in cross-linguistic influence from either a first or second language in third language learning.

Essentially, I see teaching as a reinforcement of these two principles; making the classroom a safe and inclusive place for people (people in the broadest sense of the word including all races, creeds, and identities) and also a place where the student feels in control of their education.\n            I’ve been fortunate enough to have tutored undergraduate students in Spanish and German language at the University Center for Academic Excellence at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Following this, I became a graduate teaching assistant during my Masters degree at the same institution, where I came to very much enjoy sharing my passion for languages with first and second year students as I taught first and second semester Spanish courses in a hybrid format (before covid made these cool).
