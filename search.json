There were two systematic reviews done by Rothman and\ncolleagues. The first was done in 2018, but officially published in 2020\n(Puig-Mayenco et\nal. , 2020). The information coded here contains information from\nupdated systematic review coded from the appendix reported in Rothman et\nal. (2019).\nEach study was coded for several factors: L1 influence, L2 influence,\nTypological Influence or hybrid influence. In each case, a value of “1”\nmeant that the study found that the L3 was influenced by the coded\nfactor. Note that these factors were not mutually exclusive, such that\nsome are coded as “1” for more than one potential explanation (e.g.,\nsome studies are coded as “1” for both L2 influence and typological\ninfluence). Next, “mirror image” refers to the use of mirror image\ngroups within the study (opposite order of acquisition learning the same\nL3). The following fields contain the author and year the study was\npublished (many have the DOI linked), the languages involved, and\nwhether the L3 showed evidence of non-facilitative transfer. One can\nalso use the search bar to filter for authors, languages, or any keyword\ncontained in the table.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"l1_influence\":[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\"l2_status\":[0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0],\"typology\":[0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],\"hybrid_influence\":[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],\"mirror_image_groups\":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0],\"author_year\":[\"Angelovska (2017) A\",\"Angelovska (2017) B\",\"Antonova-Ünlü & Sağın-Şimşek (2015)\",\"Bardel & Falk (2007)\",\"Bayona (2009)\",\"Ben Abbes (2016) A\",\"Ben Abbes (2016): B\",\"Ben Abbes (2016): C\",\"Berends et al.

      "contents": "\nWorkflow: basics\nYou now have some experience running R code. We didn’t give you many\ndetails, but you’ve obviously figured out the basics, or you would’ve\nthrown this book away in frustration! Frustration is natural when you\nstart programming in R, because it is such a stickler for punctuation,\nand even one character out of place will cause it to complain. But while\nyou should expect to be a little frustrated, take comfort in that it’s\nboth typical and temporary: it happens to everyone, and the only way to\nget over it is to keep trying.\nBefore we go any further, let’s make sure you’ve got a solid\nfoundation in running R code, and that you know about some of the most\nhelpful RStudio features.\nCoding basics\nLet’s review some basics we’ve so far omitted in the interests of\ngetting you plotting as quickly as possible. You can use R as a\ncalculator:\n\n\n1 / 200 * 30\n\n\n[1] 0.15\n\n(59 + 73 + 2) / 3\n\n\n[1] 44.66667\n\nsin(pi / 2)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\nYou can create new objects with <-:\n\n\nx <- 3 * 4\n\n\n\nAll R statements where you create objects,\nassignment statements, have the same form:\n\n\nobject_name <- value\n\n\n\nWhen reading that code say “object name gets value” in your head.\nYou will make lots of assignments and <- is a pain to\ntype. Don’t be lazy and use =: it will work, but it will\ncause confusion later. Instead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: Alt + -\n(the minus sign). Notice that RStudio automagically surrounds\n<- with spaces, which is a good code formatting\npractice. Code is miserable to read on a good day, so giveyoureyesabreak\nand use spaces.\nWhat’s in a name?\nObject names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters,\nnumbers, _ and .. You want your object names\nto be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. We\nrecommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words\nwith _.\n\n\ni_use_snake_case\notherPeopleUseCamelCase\nsome.people.use.periods\nAnd_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention\n\n\n\nWe’ll come back to code style later, in Chapter ?? on\nfunctions. If you’re interested in learning more about about best\npractices for code style, I also recommend The tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org.\nYou can inspect an object by typing its name:\n\n\nx\n\n\n[1] 12\n\nMake another assignment:\n\n\nthis_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5\n\n\n\nTo inspect this object, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type\n“this”, press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then\npress return.\nOoops, you made a mistake! this_is_a_really_long_name\nshould have value 3.5 not 2.5. Use another keyboard shortcut to help you\nfix it. Type “this” then press Cmd/Ctrl + ↑. That will list all the\ncommands you’ve typed that start those letters. Use the arrow keys to\nnavigate, then press enter to retype the command. Change 2.5 to 3.5 and\nrerun.\nMake yet another assignment:\n\n\nr_rocks <- 2 ^ 3\n\n\n\nLet’s try to inspect it:\n\n\nr_rock\n#> Error: object 'r_rock' not found\nR_rocks\n#> Error: object 'R_rocks' not found\n\n\n\nThere’s an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious\ncomputation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in\nyour instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.\nCalling functions\nR has a large collection of built-in functions that are called like\nthis:\n\n\nfunction_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)\n\n\n\nLet’s try using seq() which makes regular\nsequences of numbers and, while we’re at it, learn more\nhelpful features of RStudio. Type se and hit TAB. A popup\nshows you possible completions. Specify seq() by typing\nmore (a q) to disambiguate, or by using ↑/↓ arrows to\nselect. Notice the floating tooltip that pops up, reminding you of the\nfunction’s arguments and purpose. If you want more help, press F1 to get\nall the details in the help tab in the lower right pane.\nPress TAB once more when you’ve selected the function you want.\nRStudio will add matching opening (() and closing\n()) parentheses for you. Type the arguments\n1, 10 and hit return.\n\n\nseq(1, 10)\n\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nType this code and notice you get similar assistance with the paired\nquotation marks:\n\n\nx <- \"hello world\"\n\n\n\nQuotation marks and parentheses must always come in a pair. RStudio\ndoes its best to help you, but it’s still possible to mess up and end up\nwith a mismatch. If this happens, R will show you the continuation\ncharacter “+”:\n> x <- \"hello\n+\nThe + tells you that R is waiting for more input; it\ndoesn’t think you’re done yet. Usually that means you’ve forgotten\neither a \" or a ). Either add the missing\npair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.\nIf you make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value. You’re\nthen tempted to immediately double-check the result:\n\n\ny <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)\ny\n\n\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\n\nThis common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment\nwith parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to\nhappen.\n\n\n(y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5))\n\n\n[1]  1.00  3.25  5.50  7.75 10.00\n\nNow look at your environment in the upper right pane:\nHere you can see all of the objects that you’ve created.\nExercises\nWhy does this code not work?\n\n\nmy_variable <- 10\nmy_varıable\n\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found\n\nLook carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but\ntraining your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off\nwhen programming.)\nTweak each of the following R commands so that they run\ncorrectly:\n\n\nlibary(tidyverse)\nggplot(dota = mpg) + \n  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))\n\n\n\nPress Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same\nplace using the menus?\n\n\n\n",

Casillas. in the Spanish and Portuguese\n            Department at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I am also a\n            current member of the Rutgers Applied\n            Phonetics group working with Professor Casillas and\n            other colleagues at Rutgers. My main interests are in third\n            language acquisition, phonetics and phonology, and language\n            pedagogy. My primary aim/interest is how bilinguals acquire\n            the phonetics and phonology of a third language.

Essentially, I see\n            teaching as a reinforcement of these two principles; making\n            the classroom a safe and inclusive place for people (people\n            in the broadest sense of the word including all races,\n            creeds, and identities) and also a place where the student\n            feels in control of their education.\n            Starting out, I was fortunate enough to have tutored\n            undergraduate students in Spanish and German language at the\n            University Center for Academic Excellence at the University\n            of North Carolina at Charlotte. Following this, I became a\n            graduate teaching assistant during my Masters degree at the\n            same institution, where I came to very much enjoy sharing my\n            passion for languages with first and second year students as\n            I taught Spanish courses in a hybrid format (before covid\n            made these cool). After graduating with my Masters, I became\n            a full time college instructor as a fellow in which I taught\n            in both full time and hybrid contexts. I was able to\n            continue teaching during my doctoral studies at Rutgers\n            University, where I taught a variety of in-person and online\n            courses. Additionally, I taught Spanish courses as an\n            Adjunct Faculty member at Mercer County Community College\n            during my PhD.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Courses Taught\n            Spanish 101 - Face to Face\n            Spanish 102 - Face to Face\n            Spanish 101 - Hybrid\n            Spanish 102 - Hybrid\n            Spanish 101 - Online\n            \n            \n            Positions Held\n            \n            Adjunct Faculty,\n            2022-Current Mercer County Community College\n            \n            \n            Teaching\n            Assistant, 2019-Current Rutgers University\n            \n            \n            Masters Teaching\n            Fellow, 2018 The University of North Carolina at\n            Charlotte\n            \n            \n            Teaching\n            Assistant, 2017 he University of North Carolina at\n            Charlotte\n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Teaching\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n              Teaching Philosophy\n              \n              I see the classroom as a safe space\n              and student centered. Essentially, I see\n              teaching as a reinforcement of these two principles;\n              making the classroom a safe and inclusive place for people\n              (people in the broadest sense of the word including all\n              races, creeds, and identities) and also a place where the\n              student feels in control of their education.\n              Starting out, I was fortunate enough to have tutored\n              undergraduate students in Spanish and German language at\n              the University Center for Academic Excellence at the\n              University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Following this,\n              I became a graduate teaching assistant during my Masters\n              degree at the same institution, where I came to very much\n              enjoy sharing my passion for languages with first and\n              second year students as I taught Spanish courses in a\n              hybrid format (before covid made these cool). After\n              graduating with my Masters, I became a full time college\n              instructor as a fellow in which I taught in both full time\n              and hybrid contexts.
