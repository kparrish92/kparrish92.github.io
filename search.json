My main interests are in third language acquisition, phonetics and phonology, and language pedagogy. My primary aim/interest is how bilinguals acquire the phonetics and phonology of a third language. In particular, my research involves Spanish-English bilinguals and their learning of a new language with a focus on near first exposure. My recent projects have involved novel-language production by bilinguals, perception in the same population, and exploratory analysis related to which factors might be associated with the variation observed in cross-linguistic influence from either a first or second language in third language learning. Outside of work and school, I love dogs (I have three), American football (go Panthers!) and language learning.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Interests\n            Third Language acquisition\n            Phonetics/Phonology\n            Second language acquisition\n            Bilingualism\n            Statistics/Data visualization\n            \n            \n            Education\n            \n            PhD in Spanish Linguistics, 2023 (Expected) Rutgers University\n            \n            \n            MA in Spanish, 2018 The University of North Carolina at Charlotte\n            \n            \n            BA in Spanish and German, 2016 he University of North Carolina at Charlotte\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Kyle Parrish\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              d-title h1 {\n                font-size: 0px;\n              }\n              \n              \n              PhD Candidate\n              \n              Rutgers University\n              \n              I am a PhD Candidate in the Second Language Acquisition and Bilingualism program working with Professor Joseph Casillas in the Spanish and Portuguese Department at Rutgers University, New Brunswick.
